## :dart: About ##
Welcome to our comprehensive React Testing Project! This repository is home to a well-structured, fully tested React application that demonstrates the use of several key technologies in the realm of testing - TypeScript, Jest, React Testing Library,Mock Service Worker and Cypress.

This project underscores the value of different levels of testing in a modern web application: unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. TypeScript is used to introduce static typing to the code, enhancing reliability and making testing more robust.

We utilize Jest, a powerful JavaScript testing framework known for its flexibility and simplicity, for the majority of our testing needs. Jest's rich API and powerful mocking capabilities make it an ideal choice for both unit and integration testing. 

React Testing Library supplements Jest, providing useful methods to render React components, fire events, and then inspect the resulting output. Its philosophy of testing components as end users interact with them helps ensure we're creating intuitive, accessible user interfaces.
Mock Service Worker provides a great features to create your own mock apis while your testing and you can use it with server side as well as your browser. We have used this for login .

Lastly, we've incorporated Cypress, a game-changing tool for writing and managing end-to-end tests. With its real-time reloading, automatic waiting, and straightforward debugging, Cypress provides a smooth experience for testing the full user journey within the application.

In this application we have done unit test for  custome hooks like useCounter and components like job application form,counter app and a login form.
we have also done E2E test for  the above three mentioned component with cypress

We're thrilled to share this journey with you. Feel free to clone, explore!
